    "- **Definition:** Cognitive load refers to the extra burden on working memory when processing information.\n",
    "  - Can arise from:\n",
    "    - Task difficulty\n",
    "    - Content complexity\n",
    "    - Problem-solving efforts\n",
    "- Goal:\n",
    "  - Reduce cognitive load\n",
    "  - Enhance working memory processing and retention in long-term memory (LTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working Memory & Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Schemas:** Concepts or ideas formed from experiences, stimuli, or environment.\n",
    "  - Help **compress information** into manageable units.\n",
    "  - Reduce working memory load.\n",
    "  - Facilitate **long-term memory storage**.\n",

    "- Assumes:\n",
    "  - **Limited working memory**  \n",
    "  - **Unlimited long-term memory**\n",
    "- **Key points:**\n",
    "  - Processing must be effective for long-term retention.\n",
    "  - Cognitive load arises during working memory operations.\n",
    "- **Factors influencing cognitive load:**\n",
    "  - **Causal factors**: Subject characteristics, task complexity, environment, and their interactions.\n",
    "  - **Assessment factors**: Mental load, mental effort, and performance outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Causal Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subject characteristics**: Cognitive ability, skills, prior knowledge.\n",
    "2. **Task complexity**: Difficulty level of problems or content.\n",
    "3. **Environment**: Noise, distractions, and learning conditions.\n",
    "4. **Mutual interactions**: Combined effect of subject, task, and environment on the learner.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Assessment Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mental load**: Imposed by task, subject, and environmental demands.\n",
    "- **Mental effort**: Cognitive capacity allocated by the learner to the task.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Reflects mental load and effort on task outcome.\n",
    "- **Processing types:**\n",
    "  - **Control processing**: Effortful, conscious processing\n",
    "  - **Automatic processing**: Effortless, mastered through repetition\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Cognitive Load\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intrinsic Load**\n",
    "   - Inherent complexity of the task or subject.\n",
    "   - Example: Complexity of a math problem.\n",
    "2. **Extraneous Load**\n",
    "   - Caused by instructional design, environmental factors, or distractions.\n",
    "   - Needs minimization for efficient learning.\n",
    "3. **Germane Load**\n",
    "   - Constructive load required for schema construction and effective information processing.\n",
    "   - Focuses on deep learning and long-term retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Cognitive Load** = Intrinsic Load + Extraneous Load + Germane Load\n",

    "\n",
    "## Strategies to Reduce Cognitive Load\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One concept per page**: Summarize key concepts clearly.\n",
    "- **Remove irrelevant items**: Focus on essential information.\n",
    "- **Chunking & categorization**: Group related information for easier recall.\n",
    "- **Consistent structure**: Develop a learning style or format for summarization.\n",
    "- **Link to learning objectives**: Connect lessons to goals and outcomes.\n",

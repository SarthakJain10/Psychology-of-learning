    "## Social and Situational Orientation to Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focus: Learning occurs within **social and situational contexts**.\n",
    "* Key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Observational learning (modeling behavior)\n",
    "  * Group learning and interaction\n",
    "  * Situated learning: Knowledge acquisition depends on **social relationships and co-participation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observational Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initiated by **Alfred Bandura**.\n",
    "* Learning occurs by **observing others** in a social context.\n",
    "* Emphasizes **group discussions, interactions, and collaboration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Situated Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning is **contextual** and occurs in communities of practice.\n",
    "* Focuses on **relationships, participation, and collaboration** rather than just content.\n",

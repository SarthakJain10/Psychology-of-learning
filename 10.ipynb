    "## **II. Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SOI) Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Mid-20th century research wrestled with whether intelligence is a single entity or a constellation of abilities. Guilford brought clarity with a multidimensional perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Guilford’s model (1955) proposed **180 different intellectual abilities** through the interaction of **three dimensions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of information processed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visual\n",
    "* Auditory\n",
    "* Symbolic (e.g., signs)\n",
    "* Semantic (meaning)\n",
    "* Behavioral\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes performed on content:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cognition (knowing)\n",
    "* Memory (remembering)\n",
    "* Divergent Production (generating multiple ideas)\n",
    "* Convergent Production (finding a single solution)\n",
    "* Evaluation (judging information)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Forms of processed information:\n",
    "\n",

    "* Relations\n",
    "* Systems\n",
    "* Transformations\n",
    "* Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOI Formula:**\n",
    "Content (5) x Operations (5) x Products (6) = **150–180 abilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual content + divergent operations + system product = unique intellectual capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduced a **three-dimensional** view of intellect.\n",
    "* Influenced creativity research through analysis of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Divergent thinking:** multiple possibilities\n",
    "  * **Convergent thinking:** best possible answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application Areas\n",

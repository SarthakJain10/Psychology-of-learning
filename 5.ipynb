    "\n",
    "## üìå Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning can occur in different ways depending on the stimulus, context, and the learner‚Äôs interaction with knowledge. Various theorists have contributed to understanding these types of learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Types of Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Non-Associative Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning from a single repeated stimulus without forming associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) **Habituation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Response to a repeated stimulus gradually decreases\n",
    "* Becomes part of regular experience\n",
    "* **Example:** Ignoring the ticking sound of a clock after some time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) **Sensitization**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Response increases when exposed to a strong or purposeful stimulus\n",
    "* Often induced through medication or external agents\n",
    "* **Example:** Increased alertness after a loud noise or drugs affecting behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Associative Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Links two or more events together\n",
    "* Forms meaningful connections\n",
    "* Occurs through coincidence, exposure, and experience\n",
    "* **Example:** Associating lightning with thunder\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Meaningful Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting new information with **prior knowledge** to create deeper understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Promoted by **David Ausubel**\n",
    "* Enhances relevance, cognition, and self-construction of knowledge\n",
    "* Opposite of rote memorization\n",
    "* Helps in conceptual understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ÄúSignificant learning occurs when new information is linked to existing cognitive structure.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Cooperative (Collaborative) Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning through **group interaction**, communication, idea sharing, and peer support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promoted by **John Dewey**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Heterogeneous groups** (diversity increases insight)\n",
    "* **Positive interdependence** (mutual benefit & support)\n",
    "* **Effective communication** and feedback\n",
    "* **Individual responsibility** (everyone contributes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clarifies doubts, encourages creativity\n",
    "* Builds social and academic skills\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Emotional Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning influenced by emotional experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strong affective stimuli impact behavior\n",
    "* Used in therapy to modify emotions and behavior\n",
    "* **Systematic desensitization** reduces irrational fears and phobias\n",
    "* Common in **clinical and counseling** contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Observational Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning by watching and imitating others.\n",
    "Part of **Albert Bandura‚Äôs Social Learning Theory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observe ‚Üí Evaluate ‚Üí Imitate ‚Üí Reinforce\n",
    "* Role models shape behaviors, manners, and habits\n",
    "* Helps develop social skills and discipline\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Learning by Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning through exploration rather than prescribed instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promoted by **Jerome Bruner**\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learner investigates concepts independently\n",
    "* Teacher acts as a **facilitator**\n",
    "* Encourages curiosity, creativity, problem solving\n",
    "* Strengthens **metacognition**: knowing how we think and learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Problem-based learning\n",
    "* Laboratory or practical tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Rote Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memorization by repetition\n",
    "* Useful for foundational knowledge like formulas or tables\n",
    "* Not effective for complex or conceptual learning\n",
    "* Plays limited role in higher-order cognitive development\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Drive Reduction Theory\n",
    "2. Incentive Theory\n",
    "3. Arousal Theory\n",

    "## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Drive Reduction Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed by:** Clark Hull (1943)\n",
    "**Core Idea:**\n",
    "Biological or psychological **needs create drives** ‚Üí Drives push behavior ‚Üí Behavior reduces the drive ‚Üí Reduction strengthens behavior.\n",

    "| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Homeostasis   | Balanced state, no unmet needs            |\n",
    "| Drive         | Internal tension (e.g., hunger, thirst)   |\n",
    "| Activation    | Goal-directed behavior to reduce drive    |\n",

    "**Based on:** Operant Conditioning (Skinner)\n",

    "**Core Idea:**\n",
    "People act to gain **rewards** and avoid **punishments**. Motivation is driven by **external incentives**, not internal drives.\n",

    "**Proposed by:** Henry Murray (1938)\n",
    "Later expanded (Yerkes‚ÄìDodson Law)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Idea:**\n",
    "People seek an **optimal level of arousal**. Too little: boredom & low performance. Too much: anxiety & poor performance.\n",

    "* Subjective and differs by personality\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feeling sleepy while studying ‚Üí drink coffee to raise arousal\n",
    "* Some enjoy nightlife (high-arousal preference) while others avoid crowds\n",

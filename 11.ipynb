    "\n",
    "Memory is a **psychological process** that enables us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acquire** information\n",
    "2. **Store** information\n",
    "3. **Retain** information\n",
    "4. **Retrieve** information when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "We constantly rely on memory to bring past learning into present situations.\n",
    "Example: Preparing for and writing exams.\n",

    "## üéØ Goals of Human Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preserving information for future use\n",
    "* Recovering stored information when required\n",
    "\n",
    "We forget irrelevant or unused information naturally.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cognitive neuroscientists explain memory through **neural network changes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning creates **new neural connections**\n",
    "* Related neurons form **patterns or networks**\n",
    "* Practice strengthens these synaptic connections\n",

    "### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recalling stored information when needed\n",
    "* Retrieval cues help us remember better\n",
    "  (like color-coding, notes, keywords)\n",

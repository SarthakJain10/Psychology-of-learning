    "## Problem-Based Learning (PBL) vs Traditional Learning\n",
    "- Traditional learning emphasizes prescribed learning, memorization, and reproduction.\n",
    "- **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** is a pedagogical approach rooted in constructive learning theories.\n",
    "- **Key characteristics of PBL:**\n",
    "  - Immersive and experiential learning\n",
    "  - Engagement with real-life problems\n",
    "  - Development of multiple skills: cognitive, social, emotional, and learning skills\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills Developed Through PBL\n",
    "1. **Self-Directed Learning**  \n",
    "   - Learners explore problems and formulate strategies independently.\n",
    "2. **Critical Thinking Skills**  \n",
    "   - Evaluation, reflection, and planning before taking action.\n",
    "3. **Cooperative Learning Skills**  \n",
    "   - Team discussions, peer tutoring, sharing perspectives.\n",
    "   - Development of social and emotional skills.\n",
    "4. **Communication Skills**  \n",
    "   - Mutual understanding, empathy, and expressing ideas clearly.\n",
    "5. **Higher-Order Thinking Skills**  \n",
    "   - Reflective, metacognitive, creative, and innovative thinking.\n",
    "6. **Information Management Skills**  \n",
    "   - Ability to gather, utilize, and apply knowledge from multiple sources.\n",
    "7. **Decision-Making Ability**  \n",
    "   - Strategic planning and evaluation of effective solutions.\n",

    "## 21st Century Learning Environment\n",
    "- Emphasizes **deep learning** with online and open-source resources.\n",
    "- Learners tackle **emerging global challenges**: climate change, energy issues, ecological problems.\n",
    "- Knowledge is capital in the knowledge society; focus on knowledge creation.\n",
    "- **Characteristics of 21st century learning:**\n",
    "  - Online, collaborative, and technology-enhanced learning\n",
    "  - Future-oriented, change-adaptive, and sustainability-focused\n",
    "  - Idea generation and innovation\n",
    "  - Global collaboration and accessibility\n",
    "  - Enculturation of learning into practice\n",
    "\n",
    "### Educational 5.0\n",
    "- Technology-enabled, advanced learning environment.\n",
    "- Focus on **learning to be**:\n",
    "  - Developing tacit knowledge (implicit, experiential)\n",
    "  - Engaging in epistemic learning frameworks\n",
    "  - Cognitive apprenticeship: learning through observation, practice, and scaffolding\n",
    "  - Productive enquiry during active leisure\n",
    "\n",

    "## Emerging Skills for the Digital Age\n",
    "- Technological navigation, coding, web design, and journaling\n",
    "- Critical thinking and problem-solving skills\n",
    "- Collaborative and social-emotional learning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept Mapping\n",
    "- **Definition:** Visual representation of knowledge; shows relationships between concepts.\n",
    "- **Components:**\n",
    "  - Nodes: represent concepts\n",
    "  - Links: directional connections between nodes\n",
    "  - Linking phrases: describe semantic relationships\n",
    "- **Purpose:**\n",
    "  - Acts as an advance organizer for lessons\n",
    "  - Enhances meaningful learning\n",
    "  - Supports memory retention in long-term memory\n",
    "  - Helps identify incorrect or incomplete ideas\n",
    "  - Promotes integrative and strategic learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Build a Concept Map\n",
    "1. Identify the **main idea** or topic.\n",
    "2. Determine **key concepts**: functions, operations, applications.\n",
    "3. Link concepts hierarchically or in networks (spider maps, flowcharts, circular, 3D structures).\n",
    "4. Use colors for different relationships or categories.\n",
    "5. Revise, expand, and elaborate periodically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Framework\n",
    "- Based on **David Ausubel's Assimilation Theory**:\n",
    "  - Concept maps act as **advance organizers**.\n",
    "  - Facilitate integration of new concepts into existing cognitive structures.\n",
    "- Supports **cognitive mapping**:\n",
    "  - Assimilates new information without altering existing knowledge\n",
    "  - Enhances long-term memory and overall cognitive performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Concept Mapping\n",
    "- Organizes knowledge holistically\n",
    "- Enhances comprehension, integration, and recall\n",
    "- Facilitates brainstorming and idea generation\n",
    "- Acts as both a learning and evaluation tool\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cognitive Maps\n",
    "- Cognitive maps are **mental representations of knowledge**.\n",
    "- Developed through concept mapping:\n",
    "  - Assimilation of new concepts into existing schemas\n",
    "  - Strengthens cognitive structure and long-term memory\n",
    "- Can be visualized using software tools for better understanding and integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "- Problem-Based Learning develops multiple cognitive, social, emotional, and decision-making skills.\n",
    "- 21st-century and Education 5.0 emphasize technology-enhanced, collaborative, and future-oriented learning.\n",
    "- Concept mapping is a powerful tool for learning, integrating, and evaluating knowledge.\n",
    "- Cognitive maps support the assimilation of new information into existing knowledge structures.\n"

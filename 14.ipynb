    "## 1. Memory Types in Long-Term Memory (LTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Declarative Knowledge\n",
    "- **Definition:** Knowledge of facts, numbers, dates, names, and verbal data.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - \"Know what\"\n",
    "  - Extensive capacity\n",
    "  - Explicit memory, can be consciously recalled\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Procedural Knowledge\n",
    "- **Definition:** Knowledge of processes, methods, and skills.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - \"Know how\"\n",
    "  - Includes problem-solving strategies, formulas, lab experiments, mnemonic methods\n",
    "  - Implicit memory, usually not consciously recalled\n",
    "  - Learned over years of education and practice\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Episodic Knowledge\n",
    "- **Definition:** Memory of specific life events or episodes.\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - Graduation day\n",
    "  - Personal experiences with emotional relevance\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Autobiographical episodic memory: specific to one’s life events\n",
    "  - Experimental episodic memory: learning facts or experiments\n",
    "  - Flash memory: key vital points of an event\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Semantic Memory\n",
    "- **Definition:** Memory of meanings and concepts derived from declarative knowledge.\n",
    "- **Examples:** Gender equality, democracy, feminism\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Meaning-based encoding\n",
    "  - Derived from episodic or declarative knowledge\n",
    "  - Explicit memory\n",

    "|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Declarative | Explicit    | Facts, dates, phone numbers                       |\n",
    "| Procedural  | Implicit    | Problem-solving, lab experiments, skills         |\n",
    "| Episodic    | Explicit    | Life events, autobiographical experiences        |\n",

    "## 3. Level of Processing Theory (Craik & Lockhart)\n",
    "- **Idea:** Depth of information processing affects retention in LTM.\n",
    "- **Types of Processing:**\n",
    "  1. **Shallow Processing**\n",
    "     - Structural encoding (physical appearance)\n",
    "     - Example: Rote memorization before exams\n",
    "     - Results in poor retention\n",
    "  2. **Intermediate Processing**\n",
    "     - Phonemic/phonetic encoding (sound-based)\n",
    "     - Example: Rhyming, auditory cues\n",
    "  3. **Deep Processing**\n",
    "     - Semantic encoding (meaning-based)\n",
    "     - Elaborative rehearsal, reflection, analysis\n",
    "     - Example: Concept maps, associations, critical evaluation\n",
    "     - Results in better recall and long-term retention\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Insight:** Deeper processing → more accurate and durable memory.\n",

    "- Cognitive neuroscience approach\n",
    "- Memory capacity influenced by:\n",
    "  - Synapse complexity\n",
    "  - Sparseness of neural representation\n",
    "  - Spatial and temporal correlations\n",
    "- Neural networks integrate signals, forming memory structures\n",
    "- Highlights biological basis of memory but not explored in depth in this lecture\n",

    "## 6. Cognitive Load\n",
    "- **Definition:** Mental workload during information processing.\n",
    "- **Cognitive Architecture:**\n",
    "  - Memory system (sensory, working, LTM)\n",
    "  - Schemas (pre-existing concepts and structures)\n",
    "- **Schema Theory:**\n",
    "  - Knowledge stored in LTM in organized schemata\n",
    "  - Allows integration of large amounts of information as a single unit\n",
    "  - Automated schemata reduce storage and processing load\n",
    "  - Skilled performance achieved through complex, flexible schema integration\n",

    "## 7. Key Points\n",
    "- Declarative, procedural, and episodic memories form the backbone of LTM.\n",
    "- Level of processing influences how well information is retained.\n",
    "- Cognitive load can be managed through schema-based organization and automation.\n",
    "- Deep, elaborative processing enhances memory retention and recall.\n",
    "- Human memory processing can be compared with computer models for better understanding.\n"

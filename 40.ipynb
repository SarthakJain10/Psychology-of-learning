    "\n",
    "## Transformative Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transformative learning is a holistic pedagogical approach that continues to evolve.  \n",
    "- Based on **Mezirow's 10 stages of transformative learning**.  \n",
    "- Focuses not only on cognitive learning but also on behavior, mindset, and worldview.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Levels of Learning (Ison & Russell, 2000)\n",
    "1. **First-order change**  \n",
    "   - Traditional pedagogy: lectures, testing.  \n",
    "   - Learning for accreditation, degrees, or job skills.  \n",
    "   - Cognitive level / content knowledge focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second-order change**  \n",
    "   - Impacts personal life, thought process, civic responsibilities.  \n",
    "   - Focus on lifestyle, behavior, values, ethics, and worldview.  \n",
    "   - Encourages students to become responsible global citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third-order change (Epistemic Learning)**  \n",
    "   - Learning that changes students’ worldview.  \n",
    "   - Expands beyond local or self-interest to global responsibility.  \n",
    "   - **Reflection** is a key tool for higher-order thinking, metacognition, and ethical awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of Transformative Learning\n",
    "- Develop reflective thinking and introspection.  \n",
    "- Reframe cognitive structures and enhance metacognition.  \n",
    "- Sensitize students to social responsibilities and sustainability.  \n",
    "- Integrate **problem-based learning, experiential learning, case studies, peer learning**, and **authentic assessments**.  \n",
    "- Encourage **continuous improvement**, positive character development, and sustainable habits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to Critical Pedagogy\n",
    "- Transformative learning is grounded in **critical pedagogy theory**.  \n",
    "- Focuses on authentic dialogue, social awareness, and addressing inequalities.  \n",
    "- Encourages students to become **critics and innovators** in their society.  \n",
    "- Knowledge is applied for **social, global, and community benefit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Strategies (Sterling)\n",
    "- Large classrooms → small collaborative groups with **experiential and socially relevant projects**.  \n",
    "- Intensive residential experiences enhance learning.  \n",
    "- Combination of **online, offline, synchronous, asynchronous, virtual, and experiential learning**.  \n",
    "- Encourage **critical reflection, adaptability, and resilience**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nerstrom's Transformative Learning Model\n",
    "1. **Experience** → source of learning, skills, and insights.  \n",
    "2. **Assumptions** → forming, hypothesizing, validating assumptions.  \n",
    "3. **Challenge of Perspective** → reflection leads to challenging assumptions.  \n",
    "4. **Adopting New Perspective** → transformative learning occurs with new worldview, skills, and experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Five Major Themes:**\n",
    "- Examine prejudices, biases, and self-stereotypes.  \n",
    "- Incidental experiences → reevaluate values, build confidence, social involvement.  \n",
    "- Program structure → cohort and residential learning models.  \n",
    "- Reconceptualization of learning.  \n",
    "- Transformation through new experiences and expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contemplative Learning and Pedagogy (Latest Stage)\n",
    "- Evolved from transformative learning → focuses on **highest epistemic learning**.  \n",
    "- **Integrates:** introspection, reflection, experiential learning, social engagement, life skills, and sustainable practices.  \n",
    "- **Stages of Contemplative Practice:**  \n",
    "  1. Remedial (self-change, yoga, meditation, deep breathing)  \n",
    "  2. Physiological, psychological, philosophical, and spiritual development  \n",
    "  3. Contemplative orientation applied in classroom, community, and society  \n",

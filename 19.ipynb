    "- **Relation to other thinking types:**\n",
    "  - Prerequisite for **critical thinking** and **creative thinking**.  \n",
    "  - Closely related to **metacognitive thinking** (awareness and regulation of one’s own cognition).  \n",
    "- **Competencies involved:**  \n",
    "  - Organizing, reasoning, developing assumptions, predictive skills, problem-solving competencies.  \n",
    "- **Development strategies:**  \n",
    "  - Writing and learning texts, keeping reflective diaries or portfolios.  \n",
    "  - Constructing **concept maps** (advance organizers).  \n",
    "  - Self-checking questions, reflective discussions, negotiated learning, and debates.  \n",

    "  - **Innovativeness:** Application of creative ideas in real-world contexts.  \n",
    "  - **Creative Thinking:** The cognitive process of generating new ideas or solutions.  \n",
    "- **Manifestations:**  \n",
    "  - New approach to problems, conflict resolution, problem-solving, artistic expressions, and innovative solutions.  \n",
    "- **Cognitive requirements:**  \n",
    "  - Analytical thinking, problem-solving, organizational skills, communication, observation, and divergent/convergent thinking.  \n",
    "- **Process of creative thinking:**  \n",
    "  1. **Preparation:** Gather information from multiple sources.  \n",
    "  2. **Incubation:** Process ideas actively and subconsciously.  \n",
    "  3. **Insight:** Eureka moment of solution.  \n",
    "  4. **Evaluation:** Experiment, test, and assess solutions.  \n",
    "  5. **Elaboration:** Apply, narrate, and integrate into practice.  \n",
    "- **Enhancement strategies:**  \n",
    "  - Play puzzles and mental games, ask “how” and “why” questions, read extensively, travel, and interact with diverse people.  \n",
    "  - Encourage risk-taking (calculated risks).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Lateral Thinking\n",
    "- **Definition:** Expanding thinking boundaries by collecting diverse information and allowing the mind to generate multiple options.  \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Problem Solving\n",
    "- **Definition:** Solving assigned or encountered problems using systematic steps.  \n",
    "- **Strategies:**  \n",
    "  - **Trial and error:** Gradual error correction.  \n",
    "  - **Algorithm:** Applying known formulas or procedures.  \n",
    "  - **Analogy:** Applying solutions from similar past problems.  \n",
    "- **Relation to creative thinking:**  \n",
    "  - Problem-solving is often enhanced by creative thinking for generating multiple potential solutions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Problem-Based Learning (PBL)\n",
    "- **Definition:** Experiential and constructive learning approach where learners solve real-life problems.  \n",
    "- **Characteristics:**  \n",
    "  - Learners can **select or be assigned problems**.  \n",
    "  - Emphasizes experiential learning, real-life application, and skill development.  \n",
    "  - Integrates **cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills**.  \n",
    "- **Learning cycle in PBL:**  \n",
    "  1. Determine what is known and what needs to be known.  \n",
    "  2. Sequence thoughts and gather information.  \n",
    "  3. Generate potential solutions and formulate hypotheses.  \n",
    "  4. Apply new knowledge to the problem.  \n",
    "  5. Evaluate and discuss outcomes.  \n",
    "  6. Peer collaboration, sharing perspectives, and critical evaluation.  \n",
    "- **Role of learner:** Central, responsible for problem identification, strategy, evaluation, and presentation.  \n",

    "## Working Memory Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Short-term memory** is now conceptualized as **working memory**: a temporary workbench for actively processing information.\n",
    "- Working memory allows us to work on information until tasks are completed and challenges resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of Working Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Central Executive**\n",
    "   - Acts as the decision-maker.\n",
    "   - Directs attention, executes plans, and issues instructions to other components.\n",
    "   - Coordinates multiple cognitive processes simultaneously.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Visual Sketchpad**\n",
    "   - Holds and manipulates **visual information** such as images and spatial data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Phonological Loop**\n",
    "   - Processes **auditory/verbal information**.\n",
    "   - Uses rehearsal mechanisms to prevent rapid decay of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Episodic Buffer**\n",
    "   - Integrates visual, auditory, and spatial information.\n",
    "   - Acts as an attentional system to combine multiple sources of information.\n",
    "   - Interfaces with **Long-Term Memory (LTM)** to store episodic memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions of Working Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dual Channel Processing**\n",
    "   - Information is processed via two separate channels: **visual/pictorial** and **auditory/verbal**.\n",
    "   - Known as **Dual Coding Theory** (Paivio & Baddeley, 1998).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited Capacity**\n",
    "   - Working memory has a finite ability to hold information.\n",
    "   - Example: Visual memory digit span = ~5 Â± 2 items; auditory memory has similar constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Active Processing**\n",
    "   - Meaningful learning requires **substantial cognitive effort** to process verbal and visual information.\n",
    "   - Active processing enables retention in LTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of Working Memory Functioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual and auditory information systems are **relatively independent**.\n",
    "- **Simultaneous/mixed-mode presentation** (multimedia) enhances learning by reinforcing both channels.\n",
    "- Working memory predicts performance in complex cognitive tasks such as:\n",
    "  - Planning\n",
    "  - Problem-solving\n",
    "  - Decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Knowledge Types in Working Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Procedural Knowledge**\n",
    "   - \"Know-how\" information or action-oriented skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantic Knowledge**\n",
    "   - Abstract or meaningful interpretation of information.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Working memory is a **limited-capacity, multi-component system**.\n",
    "- Essential for **meaningful learning, reasoning, comprehension, and analysis**.\n",
    "- Complex tasks require a mental workspace to hold and manipulate information.\n",
    "- Continuous interface exists between **working memory** and **long-term memory**.\n",
    "- Effective strategies can **enhance working memory capacity** and improve long-term retention.\n"

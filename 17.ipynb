    "## Introduction\n",
    "- Continuation of **strategic thinking skills, processes, and mechanisms**.  \n",
    "- New concept: **Cognitive Architecture**.\n",

    "## Cognitive Architecture\n",
    "- Serves as a **computational model of the brain**, often used in cognitive science and computer science.  \n",
    "- Helps understand:  \n",
    "  - Brain structure and components  \n",
    "  - How the mind functions  \n",
    "  - How cognitive processes operate  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Brain as a Computer Analogy**  \n",
    "   - Memories: working memory, long-term memory, semantic and episodic memory  \n",
    "   - Activation mechanisms  \n",
    "   - Learning mechanisms: symbolic, statistical, algorithmic  \n",
    "   - Human limitations and perceptual-motor parameters  \n",
    "   - Interaction with environment: input/output  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose**  \n",
    "   - Understand how the **brain architecture activates the mind** to perform tasks.  \n",
    "   - Illustrates that **human brain functions in structured, computational ways**.  \n",

    "---\n",

    "## Cognitive Hierarchy\n",
    "- **Cognition develops hierarchically** from simple to complex through life experience and learning.  \n",
    "- Different models exist for organizing cognitive processes:  \n",
    "  - **Information processing speed**  \n",
    "  - **Attention and concentration**  \n",
    "  - **Perception**  \n",
    "  - **Working memory and long-term memory**  \n",
    "  - **Executive functions**\n",

    "## Bloom's Taxonomy of Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Developed by **Benjamin Bloom (1956)**, revised later (2001).  \n",
    "- **Three domains of learning**:  \n",
    "  1. **Cognitive** – Intellectual abilities and knowledge  \n",
    "  2. **Affective** – Emotion, motivation, values  \n",
    "  3. **Psychomotor** – Physical movement, skills, performance  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cognitive Domain (Revised Taxonomy)\n",
    "1. **Remember** – Recall facts, basic concepts  \n",
    "2. **Understand** – Explain ideas, interpret concepts  \n",
    "3. **Apply** – Use knowledge in new situations  \n",
    "4. **Analyze** – Examine, compare, distinguish components  \n",
    "5. **Evaluate** – Assess strengths, weaknesses, utility  \n",
    "6. **Create** – Generate new ideas, innovate, construct original work  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Action verbs** (describe, relate, tell) help measure learning outcomes at each level.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affective Domain (Bloom, 1964)\n",
    "- Focus: Emotions, values, appreciation, motivation  \n",
    "- Hierarchy:  \n",
    "  1. **Receiving** – Awareness of stimuli  \n",
    "  2. **Responding** – Reaction or participation  \n",
    "  3. **Valuing** – Importance attached to information  \n",
    "  4. **Organizing** – Prioritize and structure values  \n",
    "  5. **Characterizing** – Internalize values into behavior  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Psychomotor Domain\n",
    "- Focus: Physical skills, competencies, mastery  \n",
    "- Hierarchy of skill development:  \n",
    "  1. **Imitation** – Observe and copy  \n",
    "  2. **Manipulation** – Practice and follow instructions  \n",
    "  3. **Precision** – Achieve expert performance  \n",
    "  4. **Articulation** – Integrate multiple skills effectively  \n",
    "  5. **Naturalization** – Skills become automatic and effortless  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Knowledge\n",
    "1. **Factual Knowledge** – Basic data and information  \n",
    "2. **Conceptual Knowledge** – Principles, categories, theories  \n",
    "3. **Procedural Knowledge** – Skills, techniques, methods  \n",
    "4. **Metacognitive Knowledge** – Awareness of one's own learning and thinking processes  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metacognition**: \"Learning about our own learning\" – crucial for self-regulation and cognitive development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Cognitive architecture provides a **framework for understanding brain function** and the mind.  \n",
    "- Bloom’s Taxonomy links **cognition, emotion, and skill acquisition** to structured learning objectives.  \n",
    "- Metacognitive knowledge is the **highest-order cognitive ability**, guiding self-awareness and lifelong learning.\n"

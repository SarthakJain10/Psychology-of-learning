    "- **Purpose:** Framework to design effective learning, training, and development programs.\n",
    "- **Phases:**  \n",
    "  1. **Analysis** – Set goals, research target audience, identify requirements.  \n",
    "  2. **Design** – Develop learning solutions, objectives, content focus.  \n",
    "  3. **Development** – Create course content, integrate technology, prepare resources.  \n",
    "  4. **Implementation** – Execute training, deliver content, conduct sessions.  \n",
    "  5. **Evaluation** – Assess effectiveness, formative and summative evaluation.\n",

    "  - **Time Analysis** and other logistical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Phase\n",
    "- Activities:\n",
    "  - Formulate learning/training/instructional objectives\n",
    "  - Select assessment instruments, exercises, content sources\n",
    "  - Lesson planning and media selection\n",
    "  - Documentation of design blueprint (instructional, technical, visual strategies)\n",
    "  - Storyboards, user interface/experience, prototype creation\n",
    "  - Pedagogical approaches (case studies, hands-on experience, software integration)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Phase\n",
    "- Activities:\n",
    "  - Assemble content and resources\n",
    "  - Integrate required technology\n",
    "  - Revise according to feedback\n",
    "  - Organize schedule, expert sessions, hospitality, logistics\n",
    "  - Prepare materials, software, labs, websites, hands-on equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Phase\n",
    "- Actual delivery of the program\n",
    "- Procedures include:\n",
    "  - Training facilitators\n",
    "  - Course execution\n",
    "  - Feedback mechanism for iterative improvements\n",
    "  - Hands-on exercises, field visits, online/offline delivery\n",
    "  - Alignment of assessments with instructional objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Phase\n",
    "- **Formative Evaluation:** Continuous assessment during the program\n",
    "  - Quizzes, participation, module-wise exercises\n",
    "- **Summative Evaluation:** Final assessment at the end of the program\n",
    "  - Tests, certification, grading\n",
    "- Purpose: Ensure learning objectives are met and knowledge is transferable\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructional Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Illustrates interrelationships among:\n",
    "  - Instructional approaches\n",
    "  - Instructional models\n",
    "  - Instructional strategies\n",
    "  - Instructional methods\n",
    "  - Instructional skills\n",
    "- **Goal:** Align strategies, methods, and skills with learning objectives\n",
    "- **Customization:** Adjusted per audience, course, and training goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "1. **Instructional Models:** Holistic framework, e.g., Joyce & Weil:\n",
    "   - **Information Processing Model**\n",
    "   - **Behavioral Model**\n",
    "   - **Social Interaction Model**\n",
    "   - **Personal Model**\n",
    "2. **Instructional Strategies:** Direct, indirect, interactive, experiential, independent study\n",
    "3. **Instructional Methods:** Lecture, case study, cooperative learning, simulation, debate, discussion, flipped/blended learning\n",
    "4. **Instructional Skills:** Planning, presenting, demonstrating, questioning, evaluating\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructional Models (Joyce & Weil)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Processing Model\n",
    "- Focus on **cognitive development** and individual self-concept\n",
    "- Emphasizes understanding, organizing, and processing information\n",
    "- Encourages personal and societal relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavioral Model\n",
    "- Based on **behaviorist learning theory**\n",
    "- Focus on observable behavior changes\n",
    "- Instructional tasks sequenced in small steps\n",
    "- Decision-making linked to student assessment, prior knowledge, and learning styles\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## David Ausubel’s Instructional Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focus:** Meaningful learning\n",
    "- Learning is **integrated into existing knowledge structures** (mental schemas)\n",
    "- **Prior knowledge is critical**\n",
    "- **Advanced Organizer:** Primer/orientation for new learning\n",
    "  - Facilitates understanding of complex material\n",
    "  - Prepares learners mentally for new content\n",
    "- **Types of Organizers:**\n",
    "  1. **Comparative Organizer:** Activates prior knowledge, recapitulates, integrates or discriminates new info\n",
    "  2. **Expository Organizer:** Introduces new, unfamiliar material\n",
    "- **Key Principles:**\n",
    "  - Knowledge is **hierarchically organized**\n",
    "  - Learning occurs through **subsumption**\n",
    "    - New material related to existing cognitive structure\n",
    "    - Includes assimilation, accommodation, and cognitive restructuring\n",
    "- **Outcome:** Hierarchical organization of knowledge from simple to complex\n",

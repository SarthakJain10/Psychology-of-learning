    "  - Address societal, economic, and academic challenges\n",
    "  - Identify and tackle real-world problems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiential Learning\n",
    "- **Learning by doing**; applying theory in real-life contexts.\n",

    "  - Example: disaster management, climate challenges, pandemic issues\n",
    "- Students engage intellectually, socially, emotionally, and physically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle\n",
    "1. **Concrete Experience** – Act and experience\n",
    "2. **Reflective Observation** – Reflect and analyze\n",
    "3. **Abstract Conceptualization** – Formulate concepts and theories\n",
    "4. **Active Experimentation** – Apply learning to real situations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Attributes:**\n",
    "- Authentic learning tasks\n",
    "- Development of social, emotional, and cognitive skills\n",
    "- Relationships and empathy are nurtured\n",
    "- Cyclic process: observe → reflect → conceptualize → experiment → evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kolb’s Learning Styles\n",
    "1. **Diverging** – Feel and watch (sensitive to stimuli, prefer observation)\n",
    "2. **Assimilating** – Reflect and think (logical, organized, abstract)\n",
    "3. **Converging** – Think and do (practical, problem-solving, experimental)\n",
    "4. **Accommodating** – Feel and do (hands-on, intuitive, flexible)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuum Concept:**\n",
    "- Perception: concrete experience ↔ abstract conceptualization  \n",
    "- Processing: reflective observation ↔ active experimentation  \n",

    "\n",
    "Psychology originally emerged from philosophy during the 16th‚Äì17th centuries.\n",
    "By the late 19th century (around 1885 onward), psychology became an independent scientific discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning is one of the central focuses of psychology because many human behaviors, emotions, and thoughts are shaped through learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Common Misconception:\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning is only about performance, marks, grades, or exam results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Psychological Perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Brings a relatively permanent change in behavior**\n",
    "* Results from **experience, practice, or training**\n",
    "* Change is **observable** and meaningful\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning = **Change + Experience + Persistence**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> When training a pet, visible behavioral improvements indicate learning\n",
    "> although not always permanent or perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Conditions to Confirm Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Two requirements must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ‚úÖ **Observable change in behavior**\n",
    "2. ‚úÖ Change is **caused by experiences or environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning is seen as an **effect** (outcome) of interactions with environment or stimuli.\n",
    "\n",

    "## üîÑ Types of Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type                         | Description                                                                                   |\n",

    "| **Non‚ÄìAssociative Learning** | Response change without associations (e.g., reduced reaction to repeated noise = habituation) |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß© Cognitive View of Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning changes **mental constructs**: ideas, schemas, associations\n",
    "* Changes in behavior occur **because** thought patterns evolve\n",
    "* Even physical brain structure can change\n",
    "  (neural networks & brain chemistry reshape through learning)\n",

    "## üåç Principles That Influence Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Environment Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "* School, home, work, community surroundings influence learning ability\n",
    "* A rich, supportive environment boosts performance\n",
    "  (resources, emotional support, interactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ongoing debate:\n",
    "**Nature (heredity/genetics) vs. Nurture (environment)**\n",
    "Both contribute to learning, degree varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Reinforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "* Positive feedback, praise, rewards, collaboration\n",
    "* Stimulates motivation and continued learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of reinforcement:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Teacher feedback\n",
    "* Scholarships or awards\n",
    "* Peer recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Learning through Association & Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Learners:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Link new information with **past experiences**\n",
    "* Build networks of meaning between concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Facts + Concepts + Interpretations must be stored and **connected** in memory\n",
    "* Retrieval of old knowledge helps understand new ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **enduring** change\n",
    "* Caused by **experience, environment, reinforcement, and cognition**\n",
    "* Supported by changes in **brain structure and mental pathways**\n",
    "* Deeply influenced by **how learners connect prior knowledge** to new content\n",

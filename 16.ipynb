    "# **Lecture 16: Thinking and Cognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "- Today’s topic: **Thinking and Cognition**.\n",
    "- Previously discussed: memory, learning, and different learning theories.\n",
    "- **Thinking** is a cognitive activity, part of overall **cognition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cognition\n",
    "- Cognition: mental processes involved in **gaining knowledge**, **processing information**, **remembering**, and **comprehending**.\n",
    "- Includes **thinking, knowing, remembering, judging, problem-solving, summarizing, comprehending**, etc.\n",
    "- Represents **higher-level brain functions**.\n",
    "- Components of cognition:\n",
    "  - Language\n",
    "  - Imagination\n",
    "  - Perception\n",
    "  - Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking\n",
    "- **Definition**: The process of consciously generating and manipulating ideas in the mind.\n",
    "- **Importance**:\n",
    "  - Solving problems\n",
    "  - Learning new information\n",
    "  - Understanding concepts\n",
    "  - Organizing experiences\n",
    "  - Communication, negotiation, judgment\n",
    "- **Role**: Thinking is inseparable from learning and is the underlying mechanism for human cognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Thinking\n",
    "1. **Creative Thinking**\n",
    "   - Involves generating **new, original, unconventional ideas**.\n",
    "   - Related to **intelligence** (basic grasping ability required).\n",
    "   - Influenced by:\n",
    "     - Imagination\n",
    "     - Environmental inputs\n",
    "     - Personality traits\n",
    "   - Requires both **divergent and convergent thinking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Divergent Thinking**\n",
    "   - Generating **multiple solutions** to a problem.\n",
    "   - Example: **Brainstorming**\n",
    "   - Later stages involve **convergent thinking** to select the most effective solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symbolic Thinking**\n",
    "   - Thinking in terms of **symbols, mental representations, or images**.\n",
    "   - Example: Children playing with toys to replicate real-world roles.\n",
    "   - Requires:\n",
    "     - Active imagination\n",
    "     - Stimulating environment\n",
    "     - Curiosity\n",
    "     - Intrinsic motivation and mastery in a field\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts and Prototypes\n",
    "- **Concepts**: Mental representation of a group or class of objects/events.\n",
    "  - Reduce cognitive load\n",
    "  - Organize information efficiently\n",
    "- **Prototypes**: Representative example of a concept.\n",
    "  - Example: Himalayan mountains as a prototype of \"mountain\".\n",
    "- New information is compared with existing prototypes to understand or categorize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Propositions\n",
    "- Propositions: Meaningful statements formed through **manipulation of language, mental images, and ideas**.\n",
    "- Help develop **mental models, frameworks, or prototypes** to organize knowledge.\n",
    "- Essential for **strategic thinking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Effective Thinking\n",
    "- Active imagination\n",
    "- Creative and stimulating environment\n",
    "- Curiosity and inquisitiveness\n",
    "- Expertise in a subject\n",
    "- Intrinsic motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking as a Cognitive Process\n",
    "- Uses both **working memory** and **long-term memory**.\n",
    "- Involves:\n",
    "  - Encoding information\n",
    "  - Processing\n",
    "  - Retaining\n",
    "  - Transforming mental representations\n",
    "- Symbolic in nature: uses signs, symbols, and language\n",
    "- Can manifest through:\n",
    "  - Art\n",
    "  - Writing\n",
    "  - Gestures\n",
    "  - Sub-vocal/self-talk\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking Across Lifespan\n",
    "- Begins early in childhood:\n",
    "  - Initial concepts often relate to caregivers.\n",
    "  - Develops through **assimilation and accommodation**.\n",
    "- Lifelong process:\n",
    "  - Influenced by experience, exposure, and learning\n",
    "  - Often **initiated by problems or objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elements of Thought\n",
    "1. **Mental Images**\n",
    "   - Visual, kinesthetic, auditory, or olfactory\n",
    "2. **Concepts**\n",
